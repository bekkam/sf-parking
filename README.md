# SF Bicycle Parking (in progress)

A web application to locate bicyle parking racks in San Francisco.  


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Javascript (AJAX, JQuery), Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python, Jinja2, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Mapbox, Google Geocoder, Socrata Open Data API (SODA)

## Features


### Heatmap of Bicycle Parking Locations

Users can get a high level understanding of which neighborhoods/areas in San Francisco have the highest concentration of parking locations by viewing a heatmap.

### Parking Details

For more detailed information on parking locations, users can select the Marker option.  

The app uses Mapbox's MarkerClusterGroup to quickly render GeoJson data for thousands of points.

By zooming in to their desired search location, users can view individual markers.  Clicking a single marker produces a popup, customized with html to display the address, building name, number of racks, and number of parking spaces for the particular location.

### Viewing Markers within a Specified Radius of an Address

Currently users can narrow their parking location search by inputting a street address, and specifying a search radius.  For accurate results, the app uses Google's geocoding api to obtain the latitude and longitude of a user-specified address.  After creating a marker to represent the user's address, search.js adds a circle object of requested radius to the map's feature layer.  Search.js then uses Mapbox's setFilter method to render only those markers with GeoJson points within the search radius/circle object.
